#### PROBLEM DEFINITION
The goal is to minimize maintenance costs of the air pressure system (APS) of Scania trucks. Therefore, failures should be predicted before they occur. 

#### IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCESS
Python 3, Jupyter Notebook and Scikit-learn Machine Learning  library have    been used to approach this binary classification challenge.The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing.
The implementation has a HYPERPARAMETERs section at the beginning to turn on and off almost all decisions considered in the process.
